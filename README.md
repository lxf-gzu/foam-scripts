# Foam Scripts

### About
Scripts for converting force and current data into piezoelectric coefficients. Peak identification script originally written by Thomas Bina in collaboration with Christopher Petroff and Prof. Geoff Hutchison. Other scripts written by Christopher Petroff.

### Script Descriptions
**piezo-foam-analysis-v3.py**: Identify force and charge peaks from data.

**plot-analysis-v1.py**: Plot peaks from previous script output. Calculate, plot, and print to terminal the linear fit.

**analysis-v1.py**: Calculate and print to terminal the linear fit based on the first script's output.
